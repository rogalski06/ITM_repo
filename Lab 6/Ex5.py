# Determine a movie price. The rules are:
# - The normal price is $14
# - If someone is 65 or older, they pay $8.
# - If it is Tuesday, the price is $10.
# - If it is a matinee, the price is $5 for seniors and $8 otherwise
# Create variables for age (an integer), weekday (a string, e.g. “Monday”, “Friday” etc.), and matinee (a Boolean, true/false).  Print out the values of the variables and the price. The price should always be the lowest one that applies
