Build an interactive quiz application that supports asking a user at least five multiple-choice questions.

The quiz should present each question to the user, present at least four options for the answer (a-d), accept an answer from the user (e.g. "b") and let them know if their answer is correct or not.  

At the end of the quiz, it should report the final score.  

The program should not allow a user to enter an invalid response (e.g. if the responses are a-d, any other response, such as "q", should be ignored and the user should be re-prompted).  

The quiz questions should be kept in a file so that it is easy to add/remove questions or to have sets of questions on different topics

Additional Requirements
    1. Write the history of scores out to a file.
    9. Add a timer for each question and give bonus points for the fastest correct quiz answers or total quiz time.
